# long_integers
A realisation of the class that implements a dynamic representation of "long" integers with the help of vector.
Length (bits) and the basis of the positional number (if the algorithm foresees) is entered as parameter.
Also there's a realisation of methods in the class, which calculate the execution speed of algorithms
by calculating the number of timer cycles.

Mathods:
1. Multiplication of non-negative integers by the Karatsuba Method;
2. Multiplication of non-negative integers by the Toom-Cook Method;
3. Multiplication of non-negative integers by the Strassen Method;
4. Multiplication of non-negative integers by the Shoenhage Method (using chinese remainder);
5. Checks if the number is prime by the Rabin-Miller Method;
6. Checks if the number is prime by the Lemur Method.
